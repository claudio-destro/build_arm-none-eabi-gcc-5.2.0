# build_arm-none-eabi-gcc-5.2.0

Yet another Bash script to cross compile GCC `5.2.0` with Newlib `2.2.0` for ARM none-eabi.

## Enviroments

Tested under:

- OSX `10.11.6` (primary development environment)
- Vagrant default/sample Linux VM `hashicorp/precise32`
- Babun `1.2.0` Cygwin `1.7.35`

## Note

The resulting GCC has been tested successfully (using **production code**) under OSX and Vagrant VM only.
